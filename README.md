# Introduction-to-Image-Processing
This project served as a primer into image processing. In this project, I learned how to detect the edges of an image, how to scale an image up or down in size, and also how to flip or rotate an image.

I would like to give credit to UW Bothell professor Dr. Tadesse Ghirmai for providing the specifications for this project.
